              A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.

          <li>Variables can contain strings: var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript";</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>If statements are a type of conditional statement. A tool to add logict to your code, that allow us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data: var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
              To adress a specific item within the array we must adress the corresponting index value i.e. shapes[0]; = "triangle", shapes[1]; = "square", etc.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over 
              e.g.  for(var x=0; x < shapes.length; x++) {console.log(shapes[x]);}</li>
          <li>Use the console.log() method to output a message to the web console, by adding an argument between the parenthesis.</li>
          <li>function helloWorld() {}: A function is a set of instructions (between the curly brackets) that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.
              A function must be called to be executed i.e. helloWorld()</li>
